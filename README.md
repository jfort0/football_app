## football_app

## This is my project for a local football club - to help with better management of training sessions attendance
## At the initial scope, its functions are to: 1. open category 2. a) manage players b) manage training sessions c) view/export attendance for each month - for each existing category by saving data in sql database
## Maybe I'll develop it in more directions, but that's it for now

## It uses kivy module and it's goal is to develop mobile app

## At this point project is 1/3 completed (in its initial scope)
